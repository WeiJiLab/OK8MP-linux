RELEASE DATE:       2020-06-18

VERSION:            6.1.3

################################################################################

BINARY COMPATIBILITY
=========================
Applications built with pylon 6.1.0 are compatible with pylon 6.1.3.


NEW FEATURES / CHANGES
=========================
* pylon Viewer: Added a command-line switch that allows you to force hardware
  or software rendering. This may be useful in case you notice problems with
  displaying the Welcome dialog, for example.


CORRECTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue that may have caused unexpected termination on
  some armhf and aarch64 processors.


RESTRICTIONS
=========================
* pylon Viewer: To use the pylon Viewer, you must install the latest Mesa OpenGL driver for
  your system. On Debian-based platforms, you will also need to install the libgl1-mesa-dri
  and libgl1-mesa-glx packages.
* pylon C: The pylon C API doesn't support the Basler Compression Beyond
        feature yet.
* pylon C: For using the GenTL Consumer (e.g., with CoaXPress),
        additional functionality was added to pylon C to be able
        to start and stop streaming explicitly. This functionality has not been
        documented in the pylon C programmer's guides yet.
        Please refer to the pylon C++ programmer's guide (see chapter "Migrating
        from Previous Versions - Changes in the IStreamGrabber API") or the
        pylonC OverlappedGrab programming sample.
* GenTL: [133711] Limited GenTL support to producers with GenTL version 1.5
         and above.
* CXP: In rare cases, the camera is not found after booting the computer. Power-cycle
       the camera to resolve this.
* CXP: Grabbing with very high frame rates above 50000 fps using the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card 1C is not supported.
* CXP: When allocating buffers used for grabbing, the buffer address must be
       aligned to 8-byte increments. This is automatically the case if you use
       heap memory.
* CXP: If a version of the Silicon Software Runtime is installed on your computer,
       you may experience incompatibility issues when using CoaXPress cameras
       and interface cards. Therefore, Basler advises against installing pylon
       in parallel to Silicon Software Runtime.
* MP4: MP4 video recording requires the pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 to
       be installed in order to work. The pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4
       is available for download on the Basler website.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with 20 MPixel or higher resolution
       may fail if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. To work around that,
       set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4/AVI: [139274] The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond
       feature in ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression
       Beyond feature is enabled, pylon will first disable the Compression Beyond
       feature in the camera and then start recording.
* Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
  the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
  pylon Viewer.
  To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
  fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
  use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).
* GigE Vision: Assigning a static IP address to a camera that is not in the same
  subnet as the network adapter may make the camera unreachable. To prevent this,
  set the rp_filter (reverse path filter) to 2 ("loose mode") on the camera's network
  interface. For more information, see the Assigning an IP Address to a Camera topic
  in the Basler Product Documentation.

                The GenICam cache may need to be deleted when an error condition has been
                cached that prevents the proper operation of the pylon Viewer.
* pylon Viewer: [139115] Added the shortcut CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F7 that works as a toggle for switching
                off/switching on the display of images in pylon Viewer. Image acquisition must be
                running when the shortcut is initially used (switching off image display).
* pylon Viewer: [153055] The Polling option in the Features pane is disabled by default now.
* SDK: [136913] Added support for image decompression for Basler ace 2 Pro GigE Vision and USB3
       Vision cameras that support the Compression Beyond feature.
* SDK: [108723] The pylon Migration Mode supports Basler ace 2 GigE cameras now.
       The migration mode allows you to easily adapt existing applications
       that were written for GigE cameras based on GenICam SFNC 1.x so
       that they work with GigE cameras based on SFNC 2.x as well, e.g.,
       Basler ace 2 GigE cameras.
* SDK: [116863] Added the concept of interfaces to transport layers. An interface
       is used to represent a frame grabber board, a network card, etc.
       This object type is currently used mainly by the pylon GenTL
       Consumer transport layer. This is currently used for CoaXPress.
* SDK: [139226] Added the Utility_IpConfig sample, which illustrates how to configure the IP
       address of GigE cameras. In addition, this sample can be used to automatically and
	   programmatically configure multiple GigE Vision cameras. As the sample accepts command
	   line arguments, it can be directly executed, e.g., from a batch script file.
* SDK: [127827] Added the Utility_ImageDecompressor sample, which illustrates how to enable
       the compression feature in Basler ace 2 Pro cameras and how to decompress the images
	   using the CImageDecompressor class.
* SDK: [143319] Added the CInstantInterface class to handle interfaces, e.g., the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card.
* SDK: [143319] Added the Utility_InstantInterface SDK sample for working with the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card.
* SDK: [144475] New parameters for Basler ace 2 Pro camera and the Basler SLP Controller have been
       added to the CBaslerUniversalInstantCamera class.
* SDK/USB3: [149732] A new stream grabber statistic parameter called “Statistic_Out_Of_Memory_Error_Count”
            has been added. It provides information about insufficient memory on the host.
* SDK: [136974] Added GetBufferSize() function to GrabResultData and GrabResult to query the
       actual size of the grab result buffer.
* SDK: [136974] Added additional enumeration entries with correct GrabStatus_ prefix to EGrabStatus
       to conform with the naming scheme of enumerations. Old entries can still be used for
       backwards compatibility.
* SDK: [136974] Deprecated old pylon 2.x GrabStatus enumeration type. Please use EGrabStatus instead.
* SDK: [113430] Added TLInfo, InterfaceID, and DeviceID to infos during enumeration
       for pylon C++ and pylonC.
* SDK: [121880] Buffers can be cleared (filled with 0) using the ClearBufferModeEnable
       parameter of the InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120870] Calling AcquisitionStart and AcquisitionStop in InstantCamera can be enabled
       or disabled using the parameter AcquisitionStartStopExecutionEnable of the
       InstantCamera class.
* SDK: [120589] Extended IStreamGrabber with IsStartAndStopStreamingMandatory(),
       StartStreamingIfMandatory(), and StopStreamingIfMandatory().
       Calling the corresponding methods is mandatory for pylon C when using CoaXPress
       cameras. See the programmer's guides for more details.
* SDK: [131024] Added method to retrieve current payload size from Stream
       Grabber for pylon C.
* SDK: [133422] If the DeviceUserID of the camera is empty, an empty UserDefinedName entry
       will be added to the DeviceInfo object.
* SDK: [132430] Added missing documentation for CTlFactory functions.
* SDK: [153468] Standard C library define-directives are only applied by the pylon/Platform.h header
       file if not already defined previously in a translation unit.
* BPD: [152178] Updated the Basler Product Documentation to version 32.

* CXP: In rare cases, the camera is not found after booting the computer. Power-cycle
       the camera to resolve this.
* CXP: Grabbing with very high frame rates above 50000 fps using the Basler CXP-12
       Interface Card 1C is not supported.
* CXP: When allocating buffers used for grabbing, the buffer address must be
       aligned to 8-byte increments. This is automatically the case if you use
       heap memory.
* CXP: If a version of the Silicon Software Runtime is installed on your computer,
       you may experience incompatibility issues when using CoaXPress cameras
       and interface cards. Therefore, Basler advises against installing pylon
       in parallel to Silicon Software Runtime.
* MP4: MP4 video recording requires the pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4 to
       be installed in order to work. The pylon Supplementary Package for MPEG-4
       is available for download on the Basler website.
* MP4: Recording of video files with cameras with 20 MPixel or higher resolution
       may fail if the Quality parameter is set to 80 % or more. To work around that,
       set the Quality parameter to a lower value.
* MP4/AVI: [139274] The Recording feature doesn't support the Compression Beyond
       feature in ace 2 Pro cameras. When recording is started and the Compression
       Beyond feature is enabled, pylon will first disable the Compression Beyond
       feature in the camera and then start recording.
* Under certain circumstances, e.g., a very slow or busy computer,
  the Color Calibrator may not work if the camera has already been opened in the
  pylon Viewer.
  To prevent this, close the camera before using the Color Calibrator.
* SDK: Kernel 3.x or higher is required to use the pylon C API.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support action commands.
* GenTL: The GenTL producer for GigE Vision does not support multicast configurations.
* GigE Vision: Multiple IP configurations on a single network interface are not
  fully supported by the IP Configurator tool.
* BPD: The Basler Product Documentation requires advanced JavaScript support. Please
  use a modern browser, e.g., Firefox 44 (or higher), or Chrome 49 (or higher).
* GigE Vision: Assigning a static IP address to a camera that is not in the same
  subnet as the network adapter may make the camera unreachable. To prevent this,
  set the rp_filter (reverse path filter) to 2 ("loose mode") on the camera's network
  interface. For more information, see the Assigning an IP Address to a Camera topic
  in the Basler Product Documentation.

CORRECTIONS
===========

* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue where the pylon Viewer could crash when closing a camera.
* IP Configurator: Fixed message text in Contact Support dialog.
* USB3: Fixed an issue where accessing camera parameters could introduce lag to image streaming.
* GigE: Fixed an issue that caused the enumeration of the cameras to fail when using a very large
  number of network adapters.
* SDK: Fixed missing entry for Mono10p pixel type in Pylon::CPixelTypeMapper class. Mono10p can
  now be displayed by the pylon Viewer.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed a problem that caused the pylon Viewer to generate additional
  CPU load in idle state.
* SDK: The SoftwareTrigger Configuration class did not work correctly with linescan cameras.
* GigE: The device enumeration mechanism may have missed cameras if a certain number of connected
  cameras was exceeded.
* USB3: Fixed a memory leak that occurred when IDeviceFactory::IsDeviceAccessible for USB 3.0 cameras
  was called.
* SDK: ITransportLayer::ReleaseTl() did not always free the resources allocated by a transport layer.
  This fix may affect applications accidentally calling ReleaseTl() too often. Ensure
  that for every call of CTlFactory::CreateTl() there is only one ReleaseTl() call.
* SDK: Fixed thread-safety issues with the CTlFactory class.
* pylon Viewer: No camera features were shown if a device could only be opened at second attempt.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* pylon Viewer: The "Copy Camera Features" menu entry only became available after the first image had
  been grabbed.
* USB3: Exception may have been thrown when closing the camera.
* USB3: Fixed problems occurring when enabling the Line Pitch camera feature.
* USB3: Statistics: Incomplete frames were counted as 'missed frames'.
* GigE: Fixed resource leak that occurred when using action commands.
* USB3: Fixed a bug in the device enumeration which may have caused an incomplete USB 3.0 device list.
* pylon Viewer: Fixed an issue which might cause the pylon Viewer to block in case of transmission
  errors caused by the usage of inappropriate USB cables.
