Basler AG is constantly working on improving their products and services. This is
why Basler has integrated a third-party tracking tool for analyzing user interactions
in the pylon software. This tool automatically collects the following information:

* menu items clicked
* cameras connected to the computer of the user
* camera settings changed
* system specifications (e.g., processor, RAM, graphics card)

The tool will not collect any personal data. The data mentioned above is stored on a 
server for a period of 12 months. After that, the data will be deleted automatically. 
Basler uses this data to improve the pylon software and Basler cameras.

The pylon software allows you to enable/disable data tracking. However, if you disable it, 
you will not be able to benefit from certain services, e.g., notifications about new camera 
firmware or software updates.
