<h1> DLP 3D Scanner Example </h1>

<p> This example displays point clouds which are generated from 3D scanner application using DLP technology. This sample scan is of a model of a human spine sitting on top of a stand. The backdrop is the flat calibration board used for the scanner. The display lasts around 1 minute. <br>

DLP 3D Scanner application requires additional hardware components: <br>

<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. DLP LIGHTCRAFTER 4500 (http://www.ti.com/tool/dlplcr4500evm) for projecting fast and programmable patterns <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Point Gray Camera PG Flea3, USB3, (https://www.ptgrey.com) for capturing high-speed patterns <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. AM572x EVM (http://www.ti.com/tool/TMDSEVM572X) acting as the host to generate the structured light, decoding the captured images, and reconstruct the point clouds<br>
