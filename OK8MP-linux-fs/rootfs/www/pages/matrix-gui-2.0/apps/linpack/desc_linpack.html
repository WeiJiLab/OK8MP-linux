<h1> Linpack Benchmark Overview </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> The Linpack benchmark measures the performance of single precision floating point operations </p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
<p>- Linpack was originally inteded for use on supercomputers in the 1970s <br>
- Linpack is small enough to fit entirely into L1 cache<br></p>
<p>Input: None <br>
Output: Thousands of Floating Point Operations per Second / KFLOPS </p>
<p>Warning:<br>
If your running on a Beaglebone White/Black please plug in the 5V Power Supply.<br>
Otherwise, the board may shutdown or reboot due to using to much current from USB.</p>
