<h1> Set Governor to OnDemand </h1>

<h2> This program will set the governor to ondemand. The ondemand governor will dynamically alter the CPU's frequency depending on the system's load. Since the kernel will dynamically scale the frequency, the user is unable to manually change the frequency.</h2>
