<h1> Dhrystone Benchmark Overview </h1>

<h2> Purpose: </h2>
<p> The Dhrystone benchmark is intended to give a raw processor speed number indicating
how many dhrystones can be executed in one scecond. </p>
<h2> Additional Information </h2>
<p>- Dhrystone contains no floating point operations<br>
- Dhrystone is small enough to fit entirely into L1 cache<br>
</p>
<p>Input: (Number of Iterations) (CPU clock speed in KHz) <br>
Output: Dhrystones per Second / DMIPS/MHz 
</p>
<p>Warning:<br>
If your running on a Beaglebone White/Black please plug in the 5V Power Supply.<br>
Otherwise, the board may shutdown or reboot due to using to much current from USB.</p>
