description: SystemTap has multiple passes to convert the text of a SystemTap script into instrumentation that actually collect data on the system.  The stap_time.stp script uses the markers in SystemTap to note the amount of time that each of the passes requires.  When SystemTap completes pass 4 (compiling the instrumentation into a kernel module) the script print out the script name followed by the amount of time in milliseconds required for Pass 0 (command line option parsing), Pass 1 (script parsing), Pass 2 (elaboration), Pass 3 (code generation), and Pass 4 (module compilation).  The resulting data can be analyzed to determine if there are issues with the amount of time that systemtap takes to generate instrumentation.
