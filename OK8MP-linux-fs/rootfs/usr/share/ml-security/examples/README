This directory contains two examples called ax_sample and cloning sample.

RUNNING

  Using the examples requires the included folder 'test_images' folder and a 'test_model/inception_v3.pb'.
  This model can be downloaded and converted to a suitable format using the get_model.sh script.
  Running this script requires Bash, Python and Tensorflow and is intended for use on a Ubuntu host.

REBUILDING

  Using the Yocto SDK Toolchain for a supporting image these examples can be re-built using commands similar to the following:
    mkdir /home/user/examples-build
    cd /home/user/examples-build
    cmake $SDK_SYSROOT/usr/share/ml-security/examples
    make
  
  This should result in a binary which works on a device running the accompanying image.
